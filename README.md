Library App will display a list of books, along with appropriate info, like: book title, author name, language, page count, year of publishing etc. These data are fetched from an API that can be found in this link ```https://mocki.io/v1/4ae80738-70ac-40f6-b911-c4d9e3c452df```. So, the app simply parses the JSON response and projects the data onto a ```ListView``` as shown in the screenshots. Then, upon clicking on any of the items, the app will lead you to another page, where details info regarding that particular book will be displayed. This was implemented using ```WebView```, where it basically loads the url redirecting the user to the Wikipedia documentation for that book.
